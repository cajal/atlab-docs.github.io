Stimulus
========


Overview
--------

The stimulus schema is a self-contained application that generates, presents,
and records visual stimuli using PsychToolbox.

Monitor Requirements
--------------------

In order to view the stimulus, one needs 2 monitors at minimum while setting
one of the monitors' xscreen number *higher* than the other (e.g. xscreen 0 for
monitor 1 and xscreen 1 for monitor 2). This process can be tricky depending on
how you initially installed your monitors and set up your xscreens.

If you have a GPU on your machine, one way to check whether you have 2 xscreens
is simply checking **Nvidia X Server Settings**

.. image:: images/xscreen.jpg
    :height: 200px
    :width: 400px
    :scale: 100%
    :align: center

As you can see above, there are 2 x Screens set up.

It is best to consult with Chris Turner or Saumil Patel to configure xscreens.

Software Requirements
---------------------
Stimulus package is written in MATLAB, thus all the packages required below
must be *known* to MATLAB environment.

.. role:: raw-html(raw)
    :format: html

:raw-html:`<font color="red"><strong>MATLAB (MUST BE R2016b or above)</strong></font>`

- `PsychToolbox <http://psychtoolbox.org/download.html#installation>`_ : Stimulus package uses PsychToolbox as a backend 
- `datajoint <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63218-datajoint>`_ : It is best to simply install via *Add On* on MATLAB console

Following packages must be cloned and added to *PATH* of the MATLAB

- `mym <https://github.com/datajoint/mym.git>`_ : datajoint extension to recognize data type *BLOB*
- `pipeline <https://github.com/cajal/pipeline.git>`_ : need to be able to access *experiment* module
- `stimulus <https://github.com/cajal/stimuli.git>`_ : stimulus package itself

In order to add these packages to **PATH**, click **Set Path** on MATLAB
console and **Add with Subfolders**. See image below for what needs to be added

How to run existing stimulus
----------------------------
Unless you need to generate your own stimulus kind, you will simply run the
exsiting stimulus. Here, we will demonstrate how to run manually on your
computer. Note, when you actually run the experiment, you will do it through
**2p master** MATLAB panel. Below steps are, however, still useful when you
generate your own stimulus and need to debug/troubleshoot.

Step 1: Initialize screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    stimulus.open

Step 2: Generate stimulus conditions and queue trials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Stimulus trials are generated and queued by the scripts in the +stimulus/+conf
directory. You need to know which configuration script needs to be run.

For example, to prepare the **singledot** stimulus, execute

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    stimulus.conf.singledot

While the stimulus is loaded, you will see a sequence of dots . and asterisks
\*, which respectively indicate whether the conditions are computed anew or are
loaded from the database. Some stimuli take a long time to compute and you
might like to run the configuration before you begin the experiment.
On subsequent runs, the computed stimuli will be loaded from the database and
will not take as long.

Step 3. Run the stimulus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The stimulus must be run for a specific scan in the `experiment.Scan` table.
Table `experiment.Scan` contains a dummy entry that can be used for testing.
Its primary key is `struct('animal_id', 0, 'session', 0, 'scan_idx', 0)`.
During the experiment, the correct scan identification must be provided.

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    stimulus.run(struct('animal_id', 0, 'session', 0, 'scan_idx', 0), false)

Note, *false* is given so that we *do not log* our dummy entries to 
*stimulus.Trial()* table.

Step 4. Interrupt and resume the stimulus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While the stimulus is playing, you can interrupt with `Ctrl+c`.
The stimulus program will handle this event, cancel the ongoing trial, and
clear the screen. To resume the stimulus, repeat the stimulus.run call above.
Or to queue a new set of trials, run the configuration script again.

Step 5. Exit
^^^^^^^^^^^^
To close the stimulus program,

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    stimulus.close

Stimulus Repository Structure
-----------------------------
The structure of Stimulus repository can be confusing for new users and needs
to be explained. The basic structure can be broken down as the following tree:

        .
        .
        .

We will only focus `matlab` folder.

Under `matlab` we have folders with `+` sign prepended. For MATLAB, `+` has a
special meaning and it recognizes as a class folder.
If you are familiar with Python, think `+foldername` as a `module.py`.
Inside these `+foldername`, you have bunch of `m files` and you can think of
them as `class` definitions in Python.
If you need further help, you can refer to this
`MATLAB documentation <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/organizing-classes-in-folders.html>`__.

For those who are not familiar with Python nor classes, just treat them as a
special symbol for MATLAB to recognize that folder and m files underneath.

Let's focus on `+stimulus` first.
Inside `+stimulus`, we have `+conf`, `+core`, `+utils`, and whole bunch of m
files:

    - **+conf** : contains configuration files (singledot.m, mattise.m, etc) that specify parameters for some stimulus presentation
    - **+core** : controls and interacts with your display and Psychtoolbox. Most likely, you won't have to change anything here. But if you need to update something, consult with either Saumil or Dimitri
    - **+utils** : some help functions. Not so important unless you can find a function to be called universally across different stimuli.
    - **m files** (SingleDot.m, Matisse.m, etc): Display m files that dictate how the stimulus should be displayed.

Two important points here.

**First**, right underneath `+stimulus`, `SingleDot.m` file, for example,
dictates *how* the single dot stimulus is displayed.
We will define this file as a `PRESENTATION` file and will go through this
particular file in `Designing a New Stimulus` section line by line.

**Second** point is `singledot.m` file underneath `+stimulus/+conf/`. This is a
`CONFIGURATION` file that calls WHICH stimulus to be displayed and set
PARAMETERS for that particular stimulus.

Also, as you get more familiar/advanced with stimuli package, **`+core`** will
become more important and you should spend time understand what each file (i.e.
Visual, Screen, Control) does inside that class folder.

Notice that for PRESENTATION file, we used `camelCase <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case>`_ as naming convention.
For configuration file, we used lower case. Please keep these styles if you need to make new stimulus presentation and config files.


Now, you also notice that there is `matlab/conf` and `matlab/+stimulus/+conf`.
The reason we have TWO `conf` folders (with difference of `+` sign) is that for
`testing` a new stimulus, we put m files under `matlab/+stimulus/+conf`.
But when we actually scan, the finalized m file must be copied over to `conf`
in your `2pmaster` scanning machine because 2pmaster only recognizes folders
without `+` sign.

In short, the same config file, for example, `singledot.m`, should exist in
both `matlab/conf` and `matlab/+stimulus/+conf` once finalized.

Designing a New Stimulus
------------------------

There are two parts in designing:

1. Stimulus Presentation - `HOW` the stimulus is displayed on the monitor/projector (e.g. SingleDot.m)
2. Stimulus Configuration - `PARAMETERS` for the stimulus one designed. (e.g. singledot.m)

Often times, one doesn't probably need to design a new stimulus presentation
but simply modify the configuration file.

Here, we demonstrate a demo of designing a `single dot` stimulus

                width = self.rect(3);
                height = self.rect(4);
                x_pos = cond.dot_x + 0.5;
                y_pos = cond.dot_y + 0.5 * height/width;
                rect = [x_pos-cond.dot_xsize/2, y_pos-cond.dot_ysize/2, x_pos+cond.dot_xsize/2, y_pos+cond.dot_ysize/2]*width;
                command = struct('rect', 'FillRect', 'oval', 'FillOval');
                Screen(command.(cond.dot_shape), self.win, cond.dot_level, rect)
                self.flip(struct('checkDroppedFrames', false))
                WaitSecs(cond.dot_time - 1.5/self.fps);
                Screen(command.(cond.dot_shape), self.win, cond.dot_level, rect)
                self.flip(struct('checkDroppedFrames', false))
            end
        end
    end

Table definition
""""""""""""""""

First off, let's start with the table defintion

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:
    :caption: single-dot-table-def
    :name: single-dot-table-def

    %{
    # single dot to map receptive field
    -> stimulus.Condition
    -----
    bg_level                    : smallint                      # (0-255) the index of the background luminance, 0 is black
    dot_level                   : smallint                      # (0-255) the index of the dot luminance, 0 is black
    dot_x                       : float                         # (fraction of the x length, 0 for center, from -0.5 to 0.5) position of dot on x axis
    dot_y                       : float                         # (fraction of the x length, 0 for center) position of dot on y axis
    dot_xsize                   : float                         # (fraction of the x length) width of dots
    dot_ysize                   : float                         # (fraction of the x length) height of dots
    dot_shape                   : enum('rect','oval')           # shape of the dot
    dot_time                    : float                         # (secs) time of each dot persists
    %}

If you are not familiar with datajoint MATLAB, refer to this `documentation <https://docs.datajoint.io/matlab/>`__.

In this particular table, it inherits `stimulus.Condition` table as a
`primary attribute`.
When designing a new stimulus, you **MUST** have `stimulus. Condition` as a
`primary attribute`.

Then, it defines `bg_level, dot_level, dot_x, dot_y, etc`, in secondary
attributes with specific datatype with explanations.
Make sure each attribute is properly explained (no generic explanation) when
designing a table.

How to define a class
"""""""""""""""""""""

Now let's look at how the class is defined and what it inherits:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    classdef SingleDot < dj.Manual & stimulus.core.Visual


First, your class name must match with your filename (e.g. SingleDot). And it
must inherit 2 additional classes, namely dj.Manual and stimulus.core.Visual
(line 1). To inherit in MATLAB, you use "`<`" sign. By doing this, you declare
that your table tier is `Manual`, and you now have access to `Visual` class.
Every stimulus presentation file **MUST** inherit these two classes without
any exceptions.

How to define properties
""""""""""""""""""""""""

We can set some properties and one of the properties that you **MUST** declare
is `version` (line 2). `version` is an abstract property inherited from
`Visual class <https://github.com/cajal/stimuli/blob/master/matlab/%2Bstimulus/%2Bcore/Visual.m#L11>`__.

As you update/modify your code in development, make sure that you version up
(by whole number) as you go.

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    properties(Constant)
        version = '2'
    end

How to define methods
"""""""""""""""""""""

We can also set methods and **`showTrial`** is another abstract method
inherited from `Visual <https://github.com/cajal/stimuli/blob/master/matlab/%2Bstimulus/%2Bcore/Visual.m#L70>`__. 
In other words, you **MUST** declare it, otherwise it will throw an error.

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    methods
        function showTrial(self, cond)
            self.trialBacklogSize = 100;  % see stimulus.core.Visual
            Screen('FillRect', self.win, cond.bg_level, self.rect)
            width = self.rect(3);
            height = self.rect(4);
            x_pos = cond.dot_x + 0.5;
            y_pos = cond.dot_y + 0.5 * height/width;
            rect = [x_pos-cond.dot_xsize/2, y_pos-cond.dot_ysize/2, x_pos+cond.dot_xsize/2, y_pos+cond.dot_ysize/2]*width;
            command = struct('rect', 'FillRect', 'oval', 'FillOval');
            Screen(command.(cond.dot_shape), self.win, cond.dot_level, rect)
            self.flip(struct('checkDroppedFrames', false))
            WaitSecs(cond.dot_time - 1.5/self.fps);
            Screen(command.(cond.dot_shape), self.win, cond.dot_level, rect)
            self.flip(struct('checkDroppedFrames', false))
        end
    end

This particular block deserves some detailed explanation.

First, `showTrial` takes 2 arguments, `self` and `cond`.

**self** is a special keyword understood by MATLAB and **MUST** present as the
**FIRST** argument when defining methods.

**cond** is an argument that is in `struct <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html>`__.
Inside the struct, it must have information corresponding to what is defined in
table defintion such as `bg_level`, `dot_level`, etc.
We will further explain how condition is generated under 
:ref:`stimulus-configuration-label`.

Moving on to **line 3**, we have `self.trialBacklogSize = 100`.
Now, we never defined trialBacklogSize as our property, yet it is still 
understood here.
How? Because we inherited `Visual` class which has trialBacklogSize as a
`property <https://github.com/DonnieKim411/stimuli/blob/master/matlab/%2Bstimulus/%2Bcore/Visual.m#L27>`__!
This property dictates how many trials to accumulate before logging into 
the trials table.
If you do not specify, that is okay since the default value is set to 1.

**In line 4**, now we finally draw a rectangular box by calling `Screen`.
It is advised to read `this <http://psychtoolbox.org/docs/Screen-FillRect>`__
for better understanding of the explanation. Here, `Screen` is understood (even
though we never defined what Screen is) as PsychToolbox is added in our MATLAB
path. To draw a rectangular box, we specify `FillRect` as our first argument.
Then, we must give a pointer to the window. Again, `Visual` class already
handled it for us, and we simply call `self.win`. Then, we must give a color.
If in black/white, it can be a scalar, otherwise in 3 elemnts long array (RGB).
Lastly, we give a `rect`, which again can be found from `Visual` class.
Btw, the purpose of this line is not just simply drawing a random rectangular
box. It is there to specify the BACKGROUND for the dot to appear.

**In line 5 and 6**, we obtained width and height of our rectangle which
matches the pixel dimensions of your display.

**In line 7 through 9**, we compute WHERE the dot should appear relative to our
rectangle dimensions (here, rectangle dimension is our display dimension).
Also, it also computes the `size` of our dot.

**Line 10 and 11** are interesting.
In line 10, we defined a variable "command" with 2 mappings:
If `rect`, then its value is `FillRect`. If `oval`, then`FillOval`.
In line 11, we finally make our dot. But look at the first argument,
`command.(cond.dot_shape)`. `cond` has `dot_shape` value and it can either be
`rect` or `oval` according to our :ref:`single-dot-table-def`.
Then, our first argument becomes `command.rect` which value is `FillRect` or
`command.oval` which value is `FillOval`.
These `FillXXXX` then are commands that are understood by PsychToolbox.

**In line 12**, we now call `self.flip`. To explain what this does in detail is
probably out of our scope. But in short, what we have done so far upto line 11
is commanding the computer to `prepare` what to draw. In other words, nothing
has been `drawn` on the `display` yet. In order to do so, we have to `flip` to
fresh out frame buffer. `checkedDroppoedFrames` is an option to pass whether
to check or not. If set true and there are more than 3 frames dropped, it will
`print out the dropped frame numbers <https://github.com/DonnieKim411/stimuli/blob/master/matlab/%2Bstimulus/%2Bcore/Screen.m#L244>`__.

For those interested in detail, you can click `framebuffer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer>`__ and `page flip <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer#Page_flipping>`__.

**In line 13**, we now command to wait for `cond.dot_time - 1.5/self.fps`
seconds. At this point, the background AND the dot are present on the display
for that many seconds.

**In line 14 and 15**, we are repeating line 11 and 12. Why? By the time we
wait n seconds from line 13, there is a chance that the n seconds we waited is
`off` from what the screen `fps` is. Say our monitor shows a frame every 50 ms.
But if we waited 57 ms, for example, then we are off by 7 ms and can cause a
problem. To completely wipe out such discrepancy, we simply redraw and force
the syncing.



.. _stimulus-configuration-label:

Stimulus Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below is the content of `singledot.m <https://github.com/DonnieKim411/stimuli/blob/master/matlab/%2Bstimulus/%2Bconf/singledot.m>`__.

.. code-block:: MATLAB
    :linenos:

    function singledot
    control = stimulus.getControl;
    control.clearAll()   % clear trial queue and cached conditions

    params = struct(...
        'bg_level',    255,         ... (0-255) the index of the background luminance
        'dot_level',   0,           ... (0-255) the index of the dot luminance
        'dot_xsize',   0.125,        ... (fraction of the x length) size of dot x
        'dot_ysize',   0.125,        ... (fraction of the x length) size of dot y
        'dot_x',       linspace(-0.5,0.5,8),       ... (fraction of the x length, -0.5 to 0.5) position of dot on x axis
        'dot_y',       linspace(-0.28,0.28,5),      ... (fraction of the x length) position of dot on y axis
        'dot_shape',   'oval',       ... shape of dot, rect or oval
        'dot_time',    0.25           ... (secs) time each dot persists
        );

    % generate conditions
    assert(isscalar(params))
    params = stimulus.utils.factorize(params);

    % save conditions
    hashes = control.makeConditions(stimulus.SingleDot, params);

    % queue trials 
    nblocks = 10;
    fprintf('Total time: %g s\n', nblocks*(sum([params.dot_time])))
    for i=1:nblocks
        control.pushTrials(hashes(randperm(numel(hashes))))
    end
    end

**In line 2 and 3**, we first get `control` object and call `clearAll` method
to clear out possible trial queues and cached conditions. It is highly
recommdned to perform these two lines when designing a new stimulus.

**In line 5**, now we specify what we want for parameters that are defined in
our :ref:`single-dot-table-def`.

**In line 18**, we then factorize our conditions. Before the factorization,
condition has `dox_x` and `dot_y` values an array. By doing factorization,
there exists only one value per parameter for each condition.

**In line 21**, now we make the conditions. Conditions is a table that contains
hashes where each hash corresponds to each stimulus type for a given parameter.
One can see what condition table looks like by prompting `stimulus.Condition`:

.. image:: images/stimulus_condition.jpg
    :height: 200px
    :width: 400px
    :scale: 100%
    :align: center


Now remember we talked about dots and astericks when we ran an existing
stimulus? Those prompts are printed out from this particular line. It looks at
the given stimulus type and its paramemters, and if it finds that particular
combination in our `stimulus.Condition table`, then it simply loads that
condition (with dots as loading sign). If not, then it will generate for you (
with astericks as generating sign).

**From line 24 to the end** dictates in `WHAT sequence` we want to show the
conditions. Here, we call `randperm` to randomize the order of the conditions.
Then those randomized conditions are pushed to control via `control.pushTrials`
and displayed.


Configuration Examples

Here, we have a list of configuration with explanation. Please contribute to
this page so that every stimulus we present is explained in details.
